        <p>
            Zombies, often depicted as the walking dead, have captured the popular imagination through countless films, books, and television shows. Originally rooted in folklore and myths from various cultures, these undead beings are typically shown as reanimated corpses with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Their origins vary, ranging from viral outbreaks to supernatural phenomena, but a consistent theme is the societal collapse they often bring about. The modern zombie narrative usually delves into themes of survival, morality, and the human instinct to endure against overwhelming odds. Over the years, zombies have evolved from mere horror story antagonists to symbols of societal decay, consumerism, and even political unrest. As they shuffle and groan their way through popular culture, zombies force us to confront our deepest fears and question what it truly means to be alive.
