            Village of Bloonsdale, Tuesday â€“ Residents of the peaceful village of Bloonsdale were left stunned and bewildered as an unexpected invasion of 'Bloons' disrupted their daily life yesterday afternoon.

Local sources say that the colorful Bloons began to appear over the horizon around 3 p.m., floating eerily en masse and casting odd shadows over the town's main square. Children initially thought it was a surprise event organized by the village council, but it soon became clear that these were no ordinary balloons.

                In a remarkable twist to the Bloonsdale saga, local wildlife became unexpected heroes in the village's hour of need. As the Bloons continued their inexplicable descent upon the village, a troop of monkeys from the neighboring forest came to the rescue. Witnesses were astounded to see these agile primates, armed with sharp darts, launching a coordinated defense against the hovering Bloons. Dart after dart, with precision and unerring accuracy, they managed to pop scores of the enigmatic invaders. It was a sight straight out of folklore: monkeys, often symbolic of mischief and playfulness, turning saviors for a beleaguered village. Local elder, Mrs. Gracie Thompson remarked, "It's as if nature itself sensed our plight and sent these monkeys to help us." By sundown, thanks to the monkeys' surprising intervention, the Bloons had been significantly reduced in number, bringing a sense of relief and wonderment to the villagers. Bloonsdale will certainly never forget the day when monkeys became their dart-wielding guardians.

   <h2 class = "aboutme2">MOAB Invasion</h2>
        <div class = "aboutmeparagraph">
            <p>
                Just when the villagers of Bloonsdale thought their troubles were over, darkening skies heralded a new, more formidable threat. Emerging from the dense clouds was the colossal silhouette of the MOAB - the Mother Of All Bloons. This mammoth blimp-like Bloon, infamous in legends, cast a daunting shadow over Bloonsdale, its size dwarfing the previously menacing Bloons.

Panic spread rapidly. The MOAB was known in hushed tales to be impervious to regular darts, its thickened exterior capable of withstanding multiple hits. As it ominously floated towards the village center, there seemed little hope of stopping this gargantuan intruder. The once-cheerful troop of dart-wielding monkeys appeared bewildered, their earlier success now overshadowed by the looming challenge.

However, amidst the growing despair, a silver lining appeared. Elderly villagers recalled an old tale of the MOAB's one vulnerability - a hidden valve that, if struck correctly, could rapidly deflate it. Under the guidance of these tales, a group of the bravest monkeys set forth on a daring mission. Scaling tall structures and trees, they aimed to get above the MOAB and target this weak spot.

The village watched with bated breath as a particularly agile monkey named Milo made a breathtaking leap from the church steeple onto the MOAB. Dart in hand, he struck the rumored valve. For a tense moment, nothing happened. But then, with a mighty whoosh, the MOAB began to deflate rapidly, crumpling to the ground in a deflated heap.

Victory cheers rang out across Bloonsdale. The day, which began with despair, ended in jubilation, with Milo and his brave troop celebrated as the true heroes of Bloonsdale. The village would forever cherish the tale of the day when monkeys outwitted the mightiest Bloon of them all.

            Bloons Tower Defense 6 is a strategy game created by Ninja Kiwi, it is part of a long history of internet browser games. The basics of the game wraps around popping enemy balloons (also known as Bloons) using towers to defend your village against raiding. These towers start as monkeys using darts to pop these swift bloons, and move onto towers such as boats or factories.
