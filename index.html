                Welcome to my blog page! I am currently studying as a student for Information Technology at British Columbia Institute of Technology, going to be studying here for a couple years.
                Then I will be going for the Bachelor of Technology: Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity after I complete this diploma.

                        As I study at school, I work as a part-time line cook at the restaurant Cactus Club. Before that I attended Capilano University to study for Engineering. Dropped out 2nd year when I figured out it wasn't my thing. Now 4 years later I decided to attend BCIT when I heard that their programs are highly reputable amongst IT companies across Vancouver.

                <p>I am currently a Level 1 student studying with Set C. We usually work together on our assignments between and after classes due to some difficult classes such as Database Systems.</p>
                <ul> I have a few favourite classes such as:
                    <li>Introduction to Systems Administration</li>
                    <li>Technical Math for IT</li>
                    <li>Scripting for IT</li>
                    <li>Fundamental Web Technologies</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To pass time between my work, I absolutely love playing video games. Been playing themn since I was a toddler way back in the Nintendo 64 days. I also grew up learning how to use the Scratch Programming language which is pretty close to using Python but much more simpler to use.
